## Description
This project is for css practice. I have added some css rules for css practice. I have added some basic rules of css like when to use display block, inline-block, inline, flex, grid, position, float, clear, margin, padding, border, background, color, font, text, etc.
## Rules Learned

### Flexbox
- Use `display: flex` for the parent container.
- Use `justify-content` to align items horizontally.
- Use `align-items` to align items vertically.
- Use `flex-direction` to define the direction of the flex items.
- Use `flex-wrap` to control whether the flex items should wrap or not.

### Block
- Use `display: block` to make an element a block-level element.
- Block-level elements take up the full width available.
- Use `width` and `height` to set the dimensions of a block element.
- Use `margin-left` and `margin-right` to control horizontal spacing.
- Block elements start on a new line and stack vertically.
- Use `padding` to create space inside the element, between the content and the border.
- Use `border` to define the border around the element.
- Use `background` to set the background color or image of the element.
- Use `color` to set the text color inside the element.
- Use `font` to set the font properties of the text inside the element.
- Use `text-align` to align the text inside the element.
