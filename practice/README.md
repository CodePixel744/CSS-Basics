block elements and inline elements:
block elements take the whole block ie the complete width of the page
block elements:paragraph,heading,list items,header,footer,main,div etc.



inline block is like best of both worlds.
display:inline-block should be used with buttons where we want to protect the previous text content.  
when we want to anchor tag like button:
then we add class .button to anchor tag
i.e, <a class="button">
and in css we style using .button{

}

specificity:id>class>element
